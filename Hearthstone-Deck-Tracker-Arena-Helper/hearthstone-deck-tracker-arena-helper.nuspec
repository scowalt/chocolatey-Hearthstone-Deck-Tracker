    <description>Arena Helper is a plugin for Hearthstone Deck Tracker that helps drafting Hearthstone arena decks by showing an overlay with card values from a tier list. The plugin tries to visually detect the arena heroes and card choices. Detected cards are displayed alongside the value of the card, that is specified in The Lightforge: Hearthstone Arena Tier List. The created deck can be saved to Hearthstone Deck Tracker.
