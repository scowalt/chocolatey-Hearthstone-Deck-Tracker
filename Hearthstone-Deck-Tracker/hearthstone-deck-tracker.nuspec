    <description>An automatic deck tracker and manager for Hearthstone

- **Tracks**:
  - Cards left in your deck or cards drawn from your deck.
  - Your handcount, deckcount and draw chances.
  - Cards played by your opponent.
  - Your opponent's handcount, deckcount and probablities of him having/drawing cards.
  - How long your opponent had each card in his hand and what cards have been mulliganed, stolen or returned.
- **Timer** for the current turn and total time spent for you and your opponent.
- The tracker tries to **automatically select the deck you are playing**.
- The cards and timer can either be displayed in an overlay (see screenshot) or in **extra windows** (Options > General > Additional Windows)
- **Deck Manager**:
  - **Import** decks from websites: arenavalue, hearthstats, hearthpwn, hearthhead, hearthstoneplayers, tempostorm, hearthstonetopdeck and hearthnews
  - Circumvent the 9 deck limit: Saved decks can be **exported to Hearthstone**. (My Decks > More...)
  - Decks can be filtered by custom **tags** and sorted by name, date and tags.
  - Set **notes** for each deck (My Decks > More...)
  - Create **screenshots** of decks (My Decks > More...)
  - **Share** your decks by exporting them as xml files or id-strings (My Decks > More...). Both can be imported via New Deck > Import.
- **Notifications**: get notified when a game or a turn starts (either by the tray icon flashing or hearthstone popping up)
- **Customization**: Almost every feature can be turned on/off separately.
- **Stats per deck**:
  - Track the result of each game (win/loss), opponents, game mode and more
  - Win/loss rate vs each class.
  - Details for each game (cards drawn, played, etc.).
  - Select which game modes to track (Options > Other).
  - Import your opponent's (partial) deck from a tracked game as a new deck.
